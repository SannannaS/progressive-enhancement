        <figcaption>The story</figcaption>
        <p><b>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <i>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</i>
            The farmer said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></b></p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <i>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</i>
            The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <i>“Oh dear, that’s too <b class="BAD">BAD</b>,”</i>
            and the farmer responded, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i>“Isn’t that great!”</i>
            Again, he said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <b class="GOOD">GOOD</b> or <b class="BAD">BAD</b> —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of <b class="GOOD">GOOD</b> fortune.</p>
